    Trinity College Dublin,  the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, is Ireland's leading university and the 101st ranked university worldwide. It prides itself as a research-driven institute known and respected globally for its culture of academic freedom, diversity of scholarship, and the highest level of academic standards.
    My PhD was focussed on combining computational analyses with laboratory testing and investigation to discover new drug candidates for Alzheimer's Disease. The work contributed to discovery of 2 patented drug compounds and at least one compound currently subject to commercial development.

    My work was funded by the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.
